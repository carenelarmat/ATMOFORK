More details are given in README_LANL_Clusters, here is a quick set up.

-Copying customized modulefiles into your personal module file and load the path
copy Example_LANL_modulefiles_cubit and Example_LANL_modulefiles_geocubit into your directory ${HOME}/modulefiles; rename them simply cubit and geocubit
setenv MODULEPATH ${HOME}/modulefiles:$MODULEPATH

-Load cubit
module load cubit

-Build your GEOCUBIT 
python setup.py build 
I think this is all that is needed and all is now in the build; However you can create a "proper" directory GEOCUBIT that way
python setup.py install --prefix=directory you have permissions on

-Once geocubit is installed, open the ${HOME}/modulefiles/geocubit and change the path accordingly; then load the module
module load geocubit

-GEOCUBIT is ready!! 
-For the loading to be automatic, look at the example_tcshrc given
