1. local directory created by cloning my fork
git clone https://github.com/carenelarmat/ATMOFORK.git 
2. Add https://github.com/geodynamics/specfem3d.git as upstream 
git remote add upstream https://github.com/geodynamics/specfem3d.git

3.Prepare new directory for compilation; configure and test make

4.create a devel branch 
git checkout -b develATMO

5."Import" version ATMO into version 3.0 by solving conflicts detected. 
(Conflicts were detected by a merge between version 2.1 ATMO and 3.0 on directory ATMOSEM)

## Location source and receiver changed for version ATMO
# controlled by USE_SOURCE_RECEIVER_Z and MODEL_ATMO 
# Added a change depth given in m if SUPPRESS_UTM_PROJECTION; in km if geographical coords

Summary of Modifications:
-DERIVATIVE SEISMOGRAMS AND SEISMOGRAMS: vel and div for "DER" seismo; velocity for normal
-surface.h has to be put in the same directory than /create_movie_shakemap_AVS_DX_GMT.f90
-Location of receivers and sources modified
  * BEHAVIOR CHANGED through USE_SOURCES_RECEIVERS_Z and MODELING_ATMO set to true in constants.h
  receivers: stbur(irec) given in km - line 391 in locate_receivers
  sources: depth is entered in km - line 269 in locate_sources
